Zomato,23-07-2023 15:52,"So basically , it's the best approach you'll ever find üòâ , like it has every restaurant you could ever find in your city !!! Ans isn't every delivery on time !,) just 2 negative points for zomato that some orders take a very long period of time and some times the order prices are too high . No doubt this is the best food ordering app but some sort of silly things are not convenient. So kindly fix these problems üôè",5,99,,,17.6.0

Zomato,24-07-2023 17:07,I tried 100 times adding an alternate number in your application but it's not done due to network issues I am unable to call and respond to your calls so I need to add my alternate number for convenience but nothing happens after the window opens to add contact.

Zomato,22-07-2023 13:28,"In recent years, Zomato support has become less responsive to customers' complaints, and chat support is not as effective as it once was. However, I activated Zomato gold last month, and now I observe that my profile account has been down upgraded to Zomato for more than 30 days. Considering the regular updates on Zomato apps, I had hoped that the issue would be resolved soon. However, the problem persists. I would appreciate it if you could check and let me know.",1,30,"Hi Shaik, we're sorry to hear that. We are constantly working to improve our support infrastructure.

Zomato,23-07-2023 06:34,Awful customer service. Zomato does not have a logical protocol for when an item is missing from your order. They simply say they tried calling the restaurant to validate but the restaurant isn't picking up the phone call. This has happened several times in last 2 days. I escalated to a supervisor and he simply refused to answer my question on their protocol. I smell something fishy. You have lost a zomato gold customer üòí,1,18,"Hi there, we are really sorry for the bad experience.

Zomato,23-07-2023 04:04,"Worst when it comes to support from them in case of missing or incorrect orders, they do not trust the customers, help chat is there still they ask you to email the issue and they connect with restaurants for verification and in case restaurant is not reachable they wont do anything and not even respond you on email for follow ups . There are much better options to go for guys other than Zomato, i will be stopping using such useless app, recommend you the same.",1,8,,,17.5.9
Zomato,17-07-2023 04:47,Not at all recommended. I've been using this Zomato from last 6 months with Zomato gold. Main issue I have faced is... If we got incorrect order they won't replace or refund or give you any coupon.. I've personally faced this many times in last few months. Same with spilled order. Even I've got spoiled food once and told the about the issue and they told from next time they make sure everything go proper... I've thrown the food in dustbin. Unfortunately we can't upload screenshots in play Store,1,56,"Hi Nitesh, we extend our sincere apologies towards the inconvenience caused to you.

Zomato,06-07-2023 16:52,A very good app for food delivery. Could do more with adding more options by adding more options for restaurants. The above was Written in 2020. Now on 2022 the app is becoming useless... Their customer service has no clue what is happening or how to solve issues. The app is going backwards rather than being progressive... instead of making it progress with time the way the app is it seems like just stagnant and not wanting to improve with the problems they are facing or will face in future...,1,225,"Hi there, thank you for bringing this matter to our notice. Your feedback is duly noted, and we'll certainly work to improve our services based on the same. We hope you have a better experience with us in the future.",15-04-2022 06:29,17.5.8
Zomato,19-07-2023 15:01,"I have had really mixed experience with zomato, sad to see most of their tie ups have not been validated by them only when it comes to taste.

Zomato,25-07-2023 07:38,"Though the app provides good services but is some major concerns are : 1) Delivery charges are often very high as compared to other apps. 2) coupans for a restaurant may not be given to everyone i.e. if you frequently order from a particular restaurant then, you will not get the coupons on that restaurant which might be given to other users 3) THE BIGGEST SETBACK is that apart from the delivery charges, Zomato does not show the actual prices of food items, it shows 25% high prices of dishes.",4,0,,,17.6.0
Zomato,20-07-2023 14:03,"Very bad customer service. They even have a paid premium membership but there isn't any change in customer service. Emails don't get replies and there is no chance of speaking to an agent on bot. The only options they provide are from a list of unrelated prompts and it's not possible to type or upload photos of any issue outside of the options they give.

Zomato,25-07-2023 10:26,"This review is not just about app experience but an overall online food buying experience- Enhanced prices just exploit the middle class. Nearly 40 Rs delivery charge for a distance of 2 km is very unjust and shows that you are just using your monopoly in the market. For a new user it becomes difficult to find even those fake coupons which apply on enhanced prices. If are not able to use them, by default you will not reduce the price, thus looking for every opportunity to just earn.",3,0,,,17.6.0
Zomato,20-07-2023 04:17,Lately the minimum order amount required to apply offer seems to be really high. Ordering for a single person will find it difficult to meet that value and claim offer.

Zomato,15-07-2023 17:28,They assigned 2 orders to my delivery guy. After picking up my order he was waiting for almost an hr for his 2nd pickup from a mall! I tried contacting customer service multiple times but they were no help! Twice they closed my issue without resolution! They weren't willing to assign the 2nd order to someone else so that he could atleast deliver mine. I had to eventually cancel my order after waiting for 2 hrs. Absolutely disappointing experience! Swiggy is way better at problem resolution.,1,68,"Hi Shoita, sorry to hear about that.

Zomato,12-07-2023 08:00,"Very bad experience with Zomato, not with their services but with their hotel tie-ups. I have been disappointed with last 3 orders & for last orders I have asked for the order replacement which was not fulfilled. I have asked many times to their customer service to initiate the talk with hotels in terms of improving their food quality, because of my personal experience what i have had with ordering from zomato, but all were not supportive. If I would have had minus rating, I would have given it.",1,234,,,17.5.9
Zomato,08-07-2023 17:24,"Zomato is fantastic! The app is easy to use, and it offers a wide range of restaurants to choose from.

Zomato,02-07-2023 16:19,"Zomato is hands down the best food app I've ever used! It's simple, convenient, and has made my food adventures so much easier. I love how easy it is to find restaurants, check menus, and read reviews all in one place. Ordering food for delivery is a breeze, and the delivery service is always reliable.

Zomato,23-07-2023 08:47,It has a 100% cancellation fee for all restaurants so if you enter the wrong address you are stuck with the order as whether you take it or not your money is gone. Please wnsure you have entered the right address. Also It forces the gold membership on you but does not delivered on its promise of upto 100% coupon on late deliveries.

Zomato,20-07-2023 15:41,"No customer service facility, recently launched some collection of coupons facility which is totally scam, it shows that you have collected the coupon but when you try to order the food by using those coupons , it shows that coupons are not eligible, eventhough if you receive wrong food items, you don't get a chance to connect with customer support executive and if by chance if you get that option, they say restaurant is wholly responsible for that.Pathetic service and they are charging too much",1,6,"Hi there, we are really sorry for the bad experience.

Zomato,19-07-2023 15:32,It is a nice app for all to order food. You don't need to go anywhere just order what you want and click place button. And in 20 to 30 minutes your order is at your door. I cut 1 stars because there is no offer for cash on delivery. But overall the zomato app is good. Thank you for reading my feedback god bless you,4,1,"Hi Sonali, glad to hear that!

Zomato,20-07-2023 15:30,"My order was delayed, and they kept increasing the delivery time. When I reached Zomato, they were not able to connect with the restaurant. When I asked for a cancellation, they said I had to pay cancellation charges. Ideally, Zomato should support the customer, as I ordered through their application. Still, they aren't bothered and are asking to ""wait for some time"". Finally, as there is no help from Zomato, I agreed to cancel the order and deduct the cancellation charge from my refund.",1,9,"Hi there, we are really sorry for the bad experience.

It always shows refund completed but the amount takes 8 to 9 days to show in acc. 2 times it has confirmed the order in cash on delhivery even if I choose online payment and after the payment it complete it shows that the order was never placed and amount will be refunded.

Why do I need to consciously remember that I have no cutlery at home; and I need to manually disable this option??? This is 4th time i ordered the and don't have any spoons to eat.

Zomato,16-07-2023 10:09,Gold membership is a scam in my last 5 order experiences. They promise on time delivery & shorter time for delivery before booking. After you book the time changes to additional 15-20 mins. You can't talk to the customer service even with a gold membership. There won't be any response for the time delay & no refund of your gold membership fee as well. Pay & wait for the cold food. Uninstalling this app for good.

When I logged in it gave me offers like 100 off or 80 off but after 1year of usage,the offers has ended. This shows that Zomato doesn't care for their old long term customers. So it's not recommended. It is beneficial calling the restaurant as most restaurant provide free delivery and food at very less price.",1,438,,,17.5.6
Zomato,21-05-2023 16:53,"Worst option for support. The chat has predefined options to select. You can't really convey the issue and ask for support. Tou can't call for sure. The delivery partner can delay whenever they want and not pick your calls. Even if you give 1 rating for a delivery, there is no follow up and action on the issue.",1,108,,,17.5.0
Zomato,15-05-2023 17:34,"Even though I'm a Zomato golden member, I had a terrible experience. When I contacted their customer care regarding missing items in my order, they didn't take my concern seriously and refused to provide a refund. Moreover, the order I received was incomplete, with cold items, and there was a lack of proper communication from their customer care team. I strongly recommend using Swiggy for ordering instead. In my opinion, Zomato doesn't deserve even a single star rating.",1,97,,,17.4.7
Zomato,10-06-2023 06:12,"This app has wide variety of options for food and delivery is also decent. Problem is they charge huge amount of extra money on top of restaurant price.

Thanks.",1,84,"Hi there, this shouldn't be happening. Please share the details to psreviewsupport@zomato.com so that we can have this checked and rectified asap.",22-11-2022 09:49,17.5.2
Zomato,17-06-2023 18:23,"Worst Customer Service. Even with gold membership, you can't reach their customer service, their AI can't resolve the issues most of the times and in case of spillage issues/order items missing you don't have the option to get a refund, all they do is issue a stupid coupon with way less value. I'm a Zomato gold membership and I am nowhere near satisfied with their service.",2,116,,,17.5.4
Zomato,06-06-2023 11:44,"I don't get various outlets get such false ratings. I guess technology cannot solve everything! Come to think of it, food delivery phenomena is an absolute disaster in India as the restaurants just want to con you and the aggregators just want to mislead you with lame offers, late deliveries and fraudulent ratings. Didn't get the ideal food for lunch but I do have some good food for thought.",1,87,,,17.5.2
Zomato,17-06-2023 19:03,"This app although provides good service, is really inaccessible for a visually impared person like me. It does not work correctly with my screen reader. Automatic shifting of pages, the app hanging while using TalkBack, not being able to read the results we have searched for, are just some of the problems faced by us and Zomato has taken no actions despite there being several petitions for the same. Even swiggy has made their app more accessible. Please do the needfull ASAP.",1,210,,,17.5.4
Zomato,12-06-2023 07:00,"Didn't want to do this, but as a very long time Zomato user, with gold subscription from very beginning, I just moved to swiggy one due to lots of issues.

Sorry, not renewing my gold subscription.",2,76,,,17.5.3
Zomato,14-05-2023 21:13,"If the delivery partner is not able to fulfill the order, they just ask you to cancel it, you get your money back, but time is lost, I think much better app available out there, which assigs a different delivery partner instead of cancelling it. üò°.

Zomato,14-05-2023 17:52,"Zomato has been a great help in finding the food I want quickly and easily. It's easy to use and the restaurant ratings help me decide which places I should try. The restaurant photos give me a good idea of what the menu looks like, and the user reviews help me decide if it's worth going to a particular place. I really appreciate how I can search for restaurants in my area and filter by cuisine, price, and rating. All in all, Zomato is a great resource for busy people who don't have time to sear",5,164,,,17.4.8
Zomato,18-06-2023 08:29,"Hi, I'm a frustrated ZOMATO GOLD member. Paying money for gold membership is for extra services, not because I have money. I don't understand that when I cancel my order, straight 100% is the cancellation fee. But why don't you refund 100% amount when you miss the on-time-delivery time which you have promised to the customer. And there is no option to call customer care and talk. This is very painful for me to pay for gold membership and the services I get from Zomato.",1,136,,,17.5.3
Zomato,27-05-2023 12:03,"Don't go for it; instead, go for Swiggy. Really bad experience with customer care. They don't address the issues smoothly. Also, delivery agents sometimes miss one of the items we ordered. Whereas with Swiggy, this was not the case, at least better than Zomato. I would strongly not recommend Zomato.",1,104,,,17.5.1
Zomato,17-06-2023 06:30,"I couldn't use Zomato credits in any of the food orders. The only option I find to resolve the issue is using chat, and there is no option to talk to customer support. I used chat more than 40 times to resolve the issue. The support says, ""I understand your concern,"" then immediately end the chat with ""I'll transfer the issue to relevant team for better resolution."" I even sent an email to zomato support. Haven't received any response. My experience is never ever use this horrible Zomato!!",1,121,,,17.5.3
Zomato,22-07-2023 12:01,"Now, Zomato has become an evil in terms of price, they are trying to loot us. There prices are double than in the real, for eg. If I am ordering something of ‚Çπ100 then the final bill would be more than ‚Çπ200. If we compare the rates shown on zomato than in real, then we will get to see their truth. So, I recommend to DELETE THIS APP OF SCAM.",1,1,,,17.5.9
Zomato,04-05-2023 08:32,"Customer care is equal to non existent, 1 missing item in my order, they said they can only give 60‚Çπ coupon take it or leave it type of attitude, the item that was missing costs 79‚Çπ + GST + delivery, Zomato really can get away with fraudulent practices, either give refund or ask they restuarant to send the missing item. Pathetic service. I request all to stop letting them get away with giving coupons. This won't change until we customers take charge of the situation. Unbelievable. -1 rating.",1,145,,,17.4.6
Zomato,10-05-2023 22:00,After update the app got really worst. It's showing all the restaurant which are closed and not filtering properly. Worst thing is we have to order above 199 then only we ll get free delivery with gold membership.. i don't understand the use of that subscription. Even asked for the cancellation with in a minute and support team says the subscription will not be cancelled. No refund. I use to love this app before now it got really worst.,1,106,,,17.4.8
Zomato,15-06-2023 16:06,"When I order food from 2 different restaurants for same address, Zomato assigns only one delivery partner for both orders. It not only delays order by very long time, but ruins the food. Horrible practice!! When you are taking charge for both orders separately, then service also separately. Very bad experience!",1,90,,,17.5.3
Zomato,08-06-2023 12:09,You could really take down prices of food items. They are always more expensive than restaurant menu prices and you guys also add additional taxes to every thing.

Zomato,22-06-2023 11:01,"If a restaurant is not open, do not show it on the list of restaurants. We end up paying for items from a restaurant that's not even open and our orders end up cancelled.

Zomato,06-06-2023 17:04,"Firstly Zomato has no control over how restaurants deliver. Have had some experiences myself. Secondly, the customer staff, which is only available on chat, is not at all supportive. Zomato look into it. Update: when I get good customer experience, it is really good. When I get bad customer experience it is actually really bad. Zomato seems to operate on the extremes.",2,43,,,17.5.1
Zomato,13-05-2023 09:11,"Zomato was better earlier. Now they are unable to manage surge. They cancelled my order after more than 1 hr of wait stating that there is no delivery partner. I stay alone and i had ordered because I was not feeling well. On top of that they state that i requested to cancel the order and later when I questioned they change the response. Sadly i empathise with the support person but, the rules and management is unable to manage. If there was 0 rating i would have rated that as well.",1,83,,,17.4.8
Zomato,21-05-2023 09:40,"The worst app. Today i made an order at 1.15 pm. After 2 hours, no delivery, no response from the delivery partner as well. I've contacted helpline of zomato. They have cancelled my order and given refund and told to order again. I've subscribed to their gold membership also. They offer on time gurantee or 100% copon. But in this case, after 2 hours they themselves cancelled the order and not given any sort of claim for the on time gurantee. Very much disappointed with the experience.",1,59,,,17.5.0
Zomato,13-05-2023 21:27,"Finally, it would be great if Zomato could introduce more filters to make searching for restaurants and menu items easier and faster. For example, having a filter for dietary restrictions or preferences would be incredibly helpful for those with specific dietary needs. Overall, Zomato is a great platform, but there is definitely room for improvement. I hope that the company can continue to evolve and improve their app to better serve their customers in the future.",4,95,,,17.4.8
Zomato,26-05-2023 03:23,"I would give -ve if that was possible. I had a party and items were missing, the restaurant guy said he can't do anything as it was an online order and I should put a refund. I started a complaint and Zomato person says they can't do anything. Spoiled the party and also wasted my money. Never using this app again. Only responses that I keep getting are AI generated. I'll start using some other app or maybe order directly from the hotel. Worst experience to a loyal customer.",1,69,,,17.5.0
Zomato,06-06-2023 07:47,"Worst app ever,every time there is something missing after I told the restaurant and delivery partner to check twice but they still forgot to send the whole order and there is always something missing or they send different items,they always messed up and and never give refund and when I send them email with photos they still said that your order is correct and refuse to acknowledge the issue and proof with photos,I'm so disappointed with their response and I'll never use this app again",1,54,,,17.5.1

Called delivery agent several time to deliver this order immediately, but he refused to do so as he is having multiple delivery. I tried to chat with zomato team for the same, but no proper resolution come from them. It took almost 2 hours to reach the food to home , and subway from my house is only 10 min away. Very worst experience with Zomato, not going to recommend.",1,84,,,17.4.6
Zomato,06-06-2023 13:36,Revised review: may be because of good amount of business Zomato became worse. For example current order. For past one hour delivery agent going away from my location. Moreover now a days they are using electric vehicles which will not go beyond 20 kmph which makes 3 km travel one hour. Need to review whether to continue or drop with this app usage. After payment we can't cancel the order and the customer is fixed.,1,51,,,17.5.1
Zomato,03-06-2023 16:29,"I'm very very dissatisfied with this app, I've got gold membership for 6 months now. They advertised Zomato Gold like, on time delivery guarantee if on time not delivered you'll get a coupon of 100% of the order value, but now after taking gold for this long every order doesn't support that on delivery guarantee. Order comes unexpectedly late and you can't contact a associate anyhow and also if you get your order wrong there's nothing you can do, they will say that they'll try to improve.

Zomato,16-06-2023 07:26,Pathetic services (Gold customer here) I was charged 100% of order fee after selecting the wrong delivery address. Even though i tried to cancel the order I couldn't as there was no cancellation option. After failing to do so i contacted the support with 15 seconds of placing the order and they refused to cancel or change the delivery location and told me to be careful with my next order. Why not give the customers a option to cancel within a stipulated time? Seems like they're only after money.,1,67,,,17.5.3
Zomato,24-06-2023 06:53,"So far happy ordering experience. Will definitely recommend it to others. Be warned though, some restaurants will change food items on their own, without your consent.

And in many restaurants, when you personally visit then menu rate is different and in app it's different so now I've stopped ordering from Zomato. I only use when i don't have any option but mostly because of delivery charges is too high like 50 rupees even the restaurant within 1 km. That's why i gave 3 star.",3,19,,,17.4.8

Zomato,29-06-2023 07:24,Never received any refund in my bank account. They don't even have the option of writing your complaint in the support desk. Only pre written options. Worst experience.

Zomato,21-05-2023 05:00,Recent experiences with Zomato have been pathetic. No proper chat support. That chat bot is a scam. Human intervention missing in every concern listed in conversation with Zomato chatbot. I have had multiple orders goofed up by Zomato in last 2 months. The worse part being I have been a premium customer of Zomato for years ( now Gold member as well). This just doesn't add up. The email support is a scam too. Why should I be burdened when either restaurant or delivery partner goods up.,1,4,,,17.5.0
Zomato,15-06-2023 16:15,the app is good. just needs more tweak on which restaurants are not taking orders during currently not accepting orders instead of being them closed. and even show all the other menu the restaurant gives even if it is not being sold at that moment so that we can see the full menu in all restaurants. rating the food per dish or even reviewing per dish could be good to know like descrpitive one maybe available only to certain rank holders kind of to make it less messy.,5,20,,,17.5.1

After 30 mins I got a call from zomato saying item is not available. Neither zomato nor restaurant had a solution. As a replacement I was asked a take one dish which made no sense.

They don't make it easy to find the coupon. You have to search every nook and corner to what has been promised in bold and gold. Big time cheats. Their customer support is the worst I have seen so far. Honestly this review is lost in many other but really hate the experience and tactics used to make fools out of us.,1,49,,,17.4.4

For example if the rate of two idly set in the hotel is Rs.40 + 1 vada Rs.10 (total - 50 Rs) But in Zomato 2 Idly sets - 50 1 vada - 15 GST - 10 Delivery charge - 15 Total - 90Rs Just think & act",2,0,,,17.5.1
